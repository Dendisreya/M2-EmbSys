# Introduction

* This project is designedÂ to provide a suitable device that assists people in maintaining social distance.
* It is intended to measure the distance between any object or person using an ultrasonic transducer and an Arduino UNO.
* It employs three distinct sensors, a buzzer, an OLED display, and an LED, so that the failure of a single device does not jeopardise the project's operation.
Because we use three different sensors, our project has a better chance of working in any situation. It is based on the simple phenomenon of sound wave reflection and produces an efficient output.
