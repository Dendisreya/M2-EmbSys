## Requirements

## Introduction

* This project is designed to provide a suitable device that assists people in maintaining social distance.
* It is intended to measure the distance between any object or person using an ultrasonic transducer and an Arduino UNO.
* It employs three distinct sensors, a buzzer, an OLED display, and an LED, so that the failure of a single device does not jeopardise the project's operation.
Because we use three different sensors, our project has a better chance of working in any situation. It is based on the simple phenomenon of sound wave reflection and produces an efficient output.

## Research
* Our society is currently dealing with the "COVID-19" health crisis. This is a contagious disease that has a significant impact on the lives of many people.
* Keeping a safe distance from others appears to be the most reliable method of slowing the spread of corona virus. However it would  be inconvenient to turn around every 30 seconds to see if anyone was approaching you.
* It would be useful if there was a device that could warn others to keep their distance from you. As a result, the primary goal of the project is to overcome the COVID situation by maintaining proper social distance through the use of this product.

## Defining Our System
* The project's main goal is to maintain social distance among the people.
* It is intended to measure the distance between any object or person using an ultrasonic transducer and   an Arduino UNO.
* The Arduino software IDE is used to programme the Arduino UNO.
* Any object within a 3cm to 3m range can be detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
* The sensor has four pins: Vcc, trigger, echo, and ground.
* The OLED has 7 pins and runs on 5 volts DC.

## SWOT Analysis
