# 2_Architecture
* The main components of our project were an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino UNO, an OLED display, LEDs, and a buzzer. These components are straightforward and widely available on the market. The ultrasonic sensor transmits and receives sound signals, whereas the Arduino UNO is a microcontroller that connects many peripheral devices. The OLED display is used to show the distance value, and the LED is used to blink the light. When an object or person exceeds the set distance, the buzzer makes a sound.
## 1. ARDUINO: 
The Arduino Uno is an open-source micro-controller board based on the Microchip ATmega 328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.
## LED: 
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are versatile, energy efficient, and durable. A light-emitting diode (a semiconductor diode which glows when a voltage is applied).
## ULTRASONIC SENSOR(HC-sr04):
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a sensor used for detecting the distance to an object using sonar. ... The HC-SR04 uses non-contact ultrasound sonar to measure the distance to an object, and consists of two ultrasonic transmitters (basically speakers), a receiver, and a control circuit.
## OLED DISPLAY: 
An OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), also known as organic electroluminescent diode, is a light emitting diode in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current.
## BUZZER: 
An electrical device that makes a buzzing noise and is used for signaling.
BREADBOARD: A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used for slicing bread.
## RESISTOR: 
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements and terminate transmission lines among other uses.
